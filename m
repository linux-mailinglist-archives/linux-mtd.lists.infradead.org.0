Yes, looks like I never replied to that one, but I think my previous
explanation were clear enough to not argue on that aspect any longer/

More on that topic. I don't think you ever tested on-die ECC on a
Micron NAND, otherwise you would have noticed that your solution
completely bypasses the on-die ECC logic (and this will clearly break
existing on-die ECC users). See, that's what I'm complaining about,
Looks like you don't really understand what you're doing.

I'm not offended, just tired going through the same driver over and
over again, reporting things that are wrong/inappropriate to then
realize you only addressed of a tiny portion of it in the following
version. My last reviews were rather incomplete because of that, and
now I'm giving up.

> Will fix this issue in the controller driver and will send the updated one.

How? You say you'll fix the issue but I'm not even sure you understand
what the issue is? Clearly, the patch you've posted doesn't fix
anything, it's just papering over the fact that your controller driver
is not supporting raw accesses (or at least, not supporting it
properly).

Have you even looked at the datasheet you pointed to in patch 2 [1]?
Just went through it, and found a field that's supposed to control the
ECC engine activation: ecc_memcfg.ecc_mode. I don't see anything
changing that field in your code, so I guess raw accesses are actually
not really happening with the ECC engine disabled... 

> Could you please let me know if this is OK.

You can send a new version, I'm just saying I won't spend time
reviewing it.
