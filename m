Hi Lee, Marek,

I will move this source code in the FMC2 bus driver. I think that I 
should be able to manage the 2 controllers with 2 drivers (the FMC2 bus 
driver and the FMC2 raw NAND driver). I will have to modify some part of 
the proposed bindings, and some updates will have to be done in the FMC2 
bus driver. All these modifications will be part of V3.

Regards,
Christophe Kerello.
