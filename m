It looks like this is a real problem, not just a "theoretical" data race.
For example, see:

utf8ncursor():
        /* The first byte of s may not be an utf8 continuation. */
        if (len > 0 && (*s & 0xC0) == 0x80)
                return -1;

and then utf8byte():
                } else if ((*u8c->s & 0xC0) == 0x80) {
                        /* This is a continuation of the current character. */
                        if (!u8c->p)
                                u8c->len--;
                        return (unsigned char)*u8c->s++;

The first byte of the string is checked in two different functions, so it's very
likely to be loaded twice.  In between, it could change from a non-continuation
byte to a continuation byte.  That would cause the string length to be
decremented from 0 to UINT_MAX.  Then utf8_strncasecmp() would run beyond the
bounds of the string until something happened to mismatch.

That's just an example that I found right away; there are probably more.

IMO, this needs to be fixed before anyone can actually use the ext4 and f2fs
casefolding stuff.

I don't know the best solution.  One option is to fix fs/unicode/ to handle
concurrently modified strings.  Another could be to see what it would take to
serialize lookups and renames for casefolded directories...
