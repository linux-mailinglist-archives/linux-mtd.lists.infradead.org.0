I don't want to introduce code which I don't know if it will ever be used.

- generic compatible eases the use. I don't have to check the dtb each time I 
change a plug-able flash, to see if I gave a wrong hint for the flash in the 
extended compatible
- people will prefer to use the extended compatible instead of trying to auto-
detect the differences at run-time (it's easier, but wrong).

If you possess 2 flashes that we can't correctly detect at run-time and you 
care to fix them, then your suggestion has a good change to be implemented. I 
will not introduce code that is not used, in the hope that it will be used. No 
compatible extension if we have a way to auto-detect the flash.
