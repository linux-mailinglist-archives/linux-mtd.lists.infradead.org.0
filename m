Sorry I missed the previous version of "read-retry and randomizer support" =

patch. =

Specific DT property is a good method to control it.

For more high-reliability concern, randomizer is recommended to enable by =

default,
but sub-page write is not allowed when randomizer is enabled.

Since most of HW ECC did not support sub-page write and we think driver to =

check
chip options flags is another simple and good way to enable randomizer.

thanks for your time and comments.
