Looks like that happens when you read less than 2k. Can you print the
CAFE_NAND_STATUS register in your trace? I suspect
CAFE_NAND_STATUS_FLASH_BUSY will be cleared, so maybe it's the way to
go if we want to make sure the check Ready/Busy pin status.

Yep, I initially thought I would need to poll the NAND_STATUS register
and added a boolean to keep track that before realizing there was a bit
in the IRQ_STATUS reg.

Can you add a trace in the IRQ handler (before the "if (!irqs)" check).
I interpreted the 'masked' state as 'irq disabled', but maybe that's
the opposite, and we're being flood by uncleared 'FLASH_RDY'
interrupts. In any case, given we're polling the IRQ_STATUS
register, I don't think we need to enable interrupts (unless the
status is only updated when the interrupt is enabled).

Using readl_poll_timeout_atomic() instead of readl_poll_timeout() might
also help.
