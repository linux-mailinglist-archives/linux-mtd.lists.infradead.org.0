I don't get your point here ;) My understanding is that HOLD# and WP# 
will
be disabled. Thus there is no "hardware write protection". What other hw
write protection do you have in mind?

Ok will add that to the commit message. Just to make sure. I've only 
tested the
32mbit part. So is it still ok to include all other flashes of this 
family?

For now. tested with the NXP FlexSPI, single and dual (no quad since we 
are
using the write protection feature and IO2 and IO3 are not connected to 
the
CPU). So write protection is also tested. I will retest the TB bit.

Only that there is no flash with that part name :( according to the 
datasheet
there is only this one temp range available. From what I've seen for now 
(esp
looking at the macronix parts) it seems to first come first serve ;)
That being said, I don't insist on keeping that name, I'm fine with any 
name,
since I've learned you cannot rely on it in any way. Eg. the w25q32jwiq 
will
be discovered as w25q32dw. Or some Macronix flashes will be discovered 
as
ancient ones.

Btw. is renaming the flashes also considered a backwards incomaptible 
change?
And can there be two flashes with the same name? Because IMHO it would 
be
better to just have the name "w25q16" regardless whether its an FW/JW/JV 
etc.
It's better to show an ambiguous name than a wrong name.
