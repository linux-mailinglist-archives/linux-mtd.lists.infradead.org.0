OK.

The SOCFPGA maintainer, Dinh Nguyen, said this:
"From the clock controller, it provides a single 200MHz clock to the NAND
IP. Inside the NAND IP, there is a /4 for the clk. The 200MHz clock is
used for the clk_x and ecc_clk."


http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2018-July/592702.html



Maybe, you are using a brand-new,
different type of SOCFPGA?

I wanted to see the past tense here instead of
future tense + subjunctive mood.

I wanted you to try it.

OK, but if you agree the 4.19.10 is working,

denali->clk_rate = 50000000; denali->clk_x_rate = 200000000;

is worth trying.

d311e0c27b8fcc27f707f8ca did not exist in 4.19

But, 7a08dbaedd36 did not exist either in 4.19


$ git describe  7a08dbae
v4.20-rc2-34-g7a08dbaedd36
$ git describe  d311e0c
v5.0-rc2-3-gd311e0c27b8f


So, your patch is getting it back to
v4.20-rc2-34-g7a08dbaedd36
where the condition for ->setup_data_interface() call
is accidentally inverted for the Denali driver.



BTW, did you notice your code was doing the opposite
to your commit description?


Your commit description goes like this:

"On SoCFPGA, denali->clk_rate = 31.25 MHz and denali->clk_x_rate = 125 MHz,
hence the driver sets NAND_KEEP_TIMINGS flag. This did not happen before
and is actually incorrect, as on SoCFPGA we do not want to retain timings
from previous stage (the timings might be incorrect or outright invalid)."


You clearly state denali->clk_rate and denali->clk_x_rate
are non-zero values.

If this patch were applied, we would end up with NAND_KEEP_TIMINGS set.
Then ->setup_data_interface() hook would be skipped.
So, the timings from previous stage would be retained.

Is this what you want to do?


One more thing, if your patch were applied,
we would get back to the situation
where the back-trace happens due to zero-division:


When denali->clk_x_rate is zero,
NAND_KEEP_TIMINGS would not be set with your patch.
So, ->setup_data_interface() would be called.

This would cause zero divion at line 781.
        t_x = DIV_ROUND_DOWN_ULL(1000000000000ULL, denali->clk_x_rate);
