with your patch applied:

# flash_lock -u /dev/mtd1 0 64
# cat 
/sys/devices/platform/soc/20c0000.spi/spi_master/spi0/spi0.0/status_reg

# flash_lock -l /dev/mtd1 0 3
# cat 
/sys/devices/platform/soc/20c0000.spi/spi_master/spi0/spi0.0/status_reg
a4


without it:

# flash_lock -u /dev/mtd1 0 64
# cat 
/sys/devices/platform/soc/20c0000.spi/spi_master/spi0/spi0.0/status_reg
00
# flash_lock -l /dev/mtd1 0 3

correct, BP should be 010b for the first two sectors.

You should be able to reproduce it with every flash >=32Mbit which has
3 BP bits.
