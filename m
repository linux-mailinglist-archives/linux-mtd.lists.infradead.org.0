In case we have an EBI node, the NFC node will be a child node of the 
EBI node.
The EBI driver will first be probed, getting all its resources and then 
it will populate all its children node (including the NFC node if this 
one is enabled). If the EBI driver is deferred because of getting one of 
its resources has failed, none of its children will be probed. They will 
be probed later when the EBI driver will succeed to get all its 
resources and will then populate all of its children.

In case we have the EBI node without its driver, none of its children 
will be populated, so the NFC node will not be probed.

Here is an exemple of the bindings proposal:
