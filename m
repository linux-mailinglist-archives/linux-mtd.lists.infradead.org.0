I apologize.  And to clarify - I am not calling you (nor Boris, nor
the MTD community) lazy. As a long-time member of this list, I know
that's far from the case. Maybe more in this case Micron deserves to
be called lazy now that I understand the history. Though that I know
is an oversimplification too. In any case, perhaps _I_ was lazy with
my phrasing and by not looking up the history here.

Again, I apologize.

From your description then, there's enough denial in Micron within
Micron that my statement does apply - that at least all future Micron
parts will have this problem. Simple logic -> if engineering won't
admit there is a problem, they're not going to get funding to fix the
problem. And it's not just going to go away in the next part, because
we all know that new part designs usually start by borrowing the old
part design and since you can't admit there's an issue it's likely the
problem will come along in the next part.

This may sound extreme, but if the point here is to force the
manufacturer to give us the information that is required to support
their devices, I'd even suggest we pull the support and either drop
the driver entirely, move it to staging, or some other extremely
obvious move that says, "we are unable to properly support this
without the manufacturers help and the manufacturer doesn't care about
it's customers." Personally, when I upgrade my kernel, I want the
kernel to SHOUT to me that there's a problem with this driver rather
than have a performance issue that I might spend the next six months
trying to figure out why.

When I start a new project, one of the first things I do is check to
see if the parts that we want to use are supported by Linux. I'd like
it when I check if a Micron SLC NAND part is supported that it is
clear there's a big issue with that part. It showing up in staging
instead in the main tree would be a clear signal.

A message to Micron and other chip vendors:  Do not attempt to hide
your bugs, we will find out and hiding this stuff simply pisses us
off. Bugs happen, we get it, expect it, and can work around or fix
them. Responsible companies do not dismiss their users and will
quickly and actively investigate reported problems and then disclose
via errata. This used to be common, even as little as 10 or 20 years
ago - there was rarely a chip that I'd use that didn't have a few
errata documents associated with it. Now, good luck getting them (even
if you can get a datasheet).

We in the embedded Linux community want to work with the vendors to
get good solid upstream support. And vendors, seriously, why the hell
are you resisting it? You've got a large number of people not on your
payroll that are invested in spending time in making you succeed
because it makes things better for them too. And note the use of the
word "upstream" - I no longer use vendor drivers. They're generally of
horribly low quality and either make me stuck on a particular 8 year
old kernel or require me to rewrite them for current versions anyway.

Tomorrow I'm calling my CMs and will start the process to remove
Micron as an approved vendor and will start qualifying alternatives.
While AFAIK (and I intend to find out for sure), we don't have a
problem with the parts we've been using, I don't want to work with a
company that is technically dishonest like Micron.

To Miquel - I appreciate your work in finding and working around the
issue.  And I appreciate the pragmatic approach to fixing it.  But
perhaps it's time to say enough is enough.

I withdraw my NAK (for what it's worth), but can we find something to
very clearly mark "you may be using a broken device, but we don't know
because Micro won't tell us and so we've conservitavely setup a
workaround for all devices that affects performance"?

I'll suggest several alternative things, from most forceful to least:
1. Drop the driver.
2. Move the driver to staging.
3. Make it a kconfig option that is on by default, with strong wording
along the way of "if you know you're using a device without this
problem, you can turn this off".
4. Shove a printk of warning level in there so it's clear in the logs
for those of use who look at the logs when we upgrade.
5. Keep it on by default, and add a white-list of known devices that
are OK to not use it. Add a big comment of why (which is there) and
instructions of how to test if your device has the problem and that if
you test and know it's clean how to send a patch to add to the
whitelist.

At a minimum, I'd like to see a combo of #3 and #4.

Thanks,
- Steve
