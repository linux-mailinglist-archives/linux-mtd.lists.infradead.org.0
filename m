Hm, you told me last week that writing wrong values to this register
caused the NAND controller to not work properly (you even had code that
was overwriting the dynamically calculated values by hardcoded ones, so
I suspect it indeed didn't work) and now you say this write to
EBU_ADDR_SEL() is optional?! Sorry but it's hard to believe, and I've
received so many contradictory information from you on that matter that
I can't really tell which one is correct. Not sure I want to keep
reviewing new versions of this driver in this context.

Regards,

Boris
