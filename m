But this is not the main problem. It is rather the intention of the
user to actually want write protect the flash (for flashes who has
proper support for them, that is the ones which have non-volatile
bits).

Flashes with volatile bits are another subject. Here it might be useful
to unlock them either at probe time or when we first write to them, so
the user doesn't need to know if its this kind of flash and he would
actually have to unlock the flash before writing. I've left the
behaviour for these flashes as it was before.

And yes, u-boot suffers from the same problem, eg. it unlocks the whole
flash too. I guess they inherited the behaviour from linux. But I
wanted to start with linux first.

No, my proposal was to divide the flashes into two categories. The
unlocking is only done on the flashes which have volatile locking bits,
thus even when the new option is enabled it won't break access to these
flashes.

What about both? A kconfig option which defines the default for the
kernel parameter? My fear is that once it is a kernel parameter it is
easy to forget (thus having the non-volatile bits, the flash is
completely unlocked again) and it is not very handy; for proper write
protection you'd always have to have this parameter.

btw. I don't see a need to have this option per flash, because once
the user actually enables it, he is aware that its for all of his
flashes. I haven't seen flashes which has non-volatile protection bits
_and_ are protected by default. There shouldn't be a noticable
difference for the user if the option when enabled.
