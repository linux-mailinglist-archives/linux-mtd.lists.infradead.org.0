I think CS-don't-care means read-write operation for NAND device to reside
on the same memory bus as other Flash or SRAM devices. Other devices on =

the =

memory bus can then be accessed while the NAND Flash is busy with internal =


operations. This capability is very important for designs that require =

multiple
NAND Flash devices on the same bus.

CS# pin goes High enter standby mode to reduce power consumption,
i.e,. standby mode w/ CS# keep High, standby current: 10 uA (Typ for 3.3V =

NAND)
        otherwise, current is more than 1 mA.
i.e,. page read current, 25 mA (Typ for 3.3V NAND)

Is this "macron op done" flag good for multiple NAND devices on
the same bus ?

Any other way to control CS# pin? if user application is really
care of power consumption, i.e,. loT.
