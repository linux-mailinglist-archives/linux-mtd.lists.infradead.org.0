I didn't mean apply my patches directly. I meant more along the lines of 
edit your patches to work on top of my series. It should be as easy as 
adding your flash's fixup hooks and its octal DTR enable hook, but if my 
series is missing something you need (like complete Profile 1.0 parsing, 
which I left out because I wanted to be conservative and didn't see any 
immediate use-case for us), let me know, and we can work together to 
address it.

Boris already explained the reasoning behind it.

Not sure what you mean by "no other specific setting".

No. We need to setup Read and PP settings first. The overall flow is 
that we first run spi_nor_setup(). This will perform a "negotiation" 
between the controller and the flash to find out a common protocol they 
both support, and then change to that protocol in spi_nor_init(). Even 
if the flash supports octal DTR protocol, we can't use if if the 
controller doesn't. That is why we want to first select the protocol in 
the framework, and only then change the flash to that protocol.

In case the controller doesn't support 8D-8D-8D protocol, we would want 
to use 1S-1S-1S protocol so the flash is at least usable. Changing to 8D 
mode before finding this out would make the flash unusable.
