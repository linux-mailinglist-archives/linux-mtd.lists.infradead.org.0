yes, you are right, the bits 22~20 your mentioned are for 1-1-8 and 1-8-8 
mode enable requirements and they are zero if Flash only supports 
1S-1S-1S,
8S-8S-8S and 8D-8D-8D, just like mx25xx series.

There are bits 8~4 for 8S-8S-8S and 8D-8D-8D mode enable sequences and
I have patched these in this patches. 

By bits 8~4 in 19 th DWORD of BFPT, driver will know enable 8S-8S-8S or
8D-8D-8D by either issue two instruction (06h and E8h) or 
by Write CFG Reg 2.

mx25xx series supports enable Octal 8S-8S-8S/8D-8D-8D mode by Write CFG 
Reg 2.

mx25xx series also supports "Command Sequences to Change to Octal DDR 
(8D-8D-8D) mode" for sure. I will patch them in next version.

For mx25* series, a fixup hook will only setup specific dummy cycles to 
device for various frequency after xSPI 1.0 table has been parsed.


thanks for your time & comments.
