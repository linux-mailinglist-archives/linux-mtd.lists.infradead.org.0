The calculation is obviously not the same anymore, due to the recent
changes in the Linux driver, which seems to have broken it (in Linux).

If the value were straight at the edge, I would expect this would
trigger errors over the years, when those values were used, or maybe it
would trigger an error in the thermal chamber tests ? If neither of that
happens, then the values are probably not at the edge enough to matter.

That said, timing calculations do not factor in only the datasheet
values, but also signal propagation delays and other details of the data
path on the PCB and in the SOC, so it's not as simple as you claim it
is. Moreover, while the NAND datasheet is available in public, the
Denali IP datasheet is not, so "do the math with a paper and compare" is
inapplicable here either way, sorry.

The timings which went through extensive testing are the original ones.

The ones coming out of Masahiro's patch at least do not trigger those
massive UBI errors, however they were tested only very lightly. And I
feel like adding +1/-1 somewhere into the patch is rather iffy, so I
would hope the Denali datasheet has something about this and why this is
needed.

Let's be clear that I still prefer "practically working and possibly
imperfect" over "theoretically perfect and practically not working".

Also, correction, thermal chamber is not an owen, it does testing over
the entire temperature range of the device.
