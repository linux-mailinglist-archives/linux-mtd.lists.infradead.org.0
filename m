Correct. My argument is based on the assumption that lock() and unlock() 
are cheap/fast operations. If you spend very little time in lock() and 
unlock(), it doesn't make a big difference if you do all 3 operations in 
one go or one at a time.

In other words, since register write should be pretty fast, locking and 
unlocking should be pretty fast. If we don't spend a lot of time in 
lock() and unlock(), we don't gain a lot of performance by reducing 
those calls.

If you still think doing all operations in one go is a better idea, I  
like Boris's idea of batching operations and its worth considering.

Right. I misread the code. Sorry.
