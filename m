Currently, it seems that we will get the incorrect data and error
operation due to CS in error toggling if CS line is controlled in =

->exec_op().
i.e,. =


1) In nand_onfi_detect() to call nand_exec_op() twice by =

nand_read_param_page_op() and annd_read_data_op()

2) In nand_write_page_xxx to call nand_exec_op() many times by
nand_prog_page_begin_op(), nand_write_data_op() and =

nand_prog_page_end_op().


Should we consider to add a CS line controller in struct nand_controller
i.e,.

struct nand_controller {
         struct mutex lock;
         const struct nand_controller_ops *ops;
+          void (*select_chip)(struct nand_chip *chip, int cs);
};

to replace legacy.select_chip() ?


To patch in nand_select_target() and nand_deselect_target()

void nand_select_target(struct nand_chip *chip, unsigned int cs)
{
        /*
         * cs should always lie between 0 and chip->numchips, when that's =

not
         * the case it's a bug and the caller should be fixed.
         */
        if (WARN_ON(cs > chip->numchips))
                return;

        chip->cur_cs =3D cs;

+       if (chip->controller->select_chip)
+               chip->controller->select_chip(chip, cs);
+
        if (chip->legacy.select_chip)
                chip->legacy.select_chip(chip, cs);
}

void nand_deselect_target(struct nand_chip *chip)
{
+       if (chip->controller->select_chip)
+               chip->controller->select_chip(chip, -1);
+
        if (chip->legacy.select_chip)
                chip->legacy.select_chip(chip, -1);

        chip->cur_cs =3D -1;
}
