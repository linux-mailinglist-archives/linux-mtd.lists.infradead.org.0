I see, this is not the case with denali nand driver though.

It might've made sense to check those driver differences before making
such an statement ;-)

That said, I don't think either U-Boot or Linux uses the ONFI
information for this NAND, but I might be wrong.

I am look at for example

 denali->reg + TCWAW_AND_ADDR_2_DATA = 0x0000143f -> 0x00001432

Register was 0x143f before, now is 0x1432 , which is less.
I guess that would be the "bad timing" then ?

Great :)
