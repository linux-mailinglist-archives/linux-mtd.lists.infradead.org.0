Again, if there's an endianness issue it's in your SPI driver, not
here, and I suspect you'd have the same issue with the address cycles.
SPI mem protocols has been using big endian for everything, and I think
that should be applied to dual-byte opcodes too.

Changing for opcode[2] would mean patching all spi-mem drivers. That's
doable, but given we already have the address field encoded in a u64, I
don't see a good reason to not apply that rule to the opcode.
