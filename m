So after making this change and thinking about it some more, I'm not sure it's
actually an improvement.

The normal use case for this ioctl is to "lock" some encrypted directory(s).  If
it returns 0 and doesn't lock the directory(s), that's unexpected.

This is perhaps different from what users expect from unlink().  It's well known
that unlink() just deletes the filename, not the file itself if it's still open
or has other links.  And unlink() by itself isn't meant for use cases where the
file absolutely must be securely erased.  But FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY
really is meant primarily for that sort of thing.

To give a concrete example: my patch for the userspace tool
https://github.com/google/fscrypt adds a command 'fscrypt lock' which locks an
encrypted directory.  If, say, someone runs 'fscrypt unlock' as uid 0 and then
'fscrypt lock' as uid 1000, then FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY can't actually
remove the key.  I need to make the tool show a proper error message in this
case.  To do so, it would help to get a unique error code (e.g. EUSERS) from
FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY, rather than get the ambiguous error code ENOKEY
and have to call FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS to get the real status.

Also, we already have the EBUSY case.  This means that the ioctl removed the
master key secret itself; however, some files were still in-use, so the key
remains in the "incompletely removed" state.  If we were actually going for
unlink() semantics, then for consistency this case really ought to return 0 and
unlink the key object, and people who care about in-use files would need to use
FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS.  But most people *will* care about this, and
may even want to retry the ioctl later, which isn't something you can do with
pure unlink() semantics.

So I'm leaning towards keeping the EUSERS and EBUSY errors.
