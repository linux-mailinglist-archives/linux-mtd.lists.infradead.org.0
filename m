My suggestion was to use SFDP wherever possible.. E.g: it is possible to
get opcode extension type from BFPT...

But using BFPT DWORD-19 is not correct for switching to 8D-8D-8D mode:

Per JESD216D.01 Bits 22:20 of  19th DWORD of BFPT:

Octal Enable Requirements:

This field describes whether the device contains a Octal Enable bit used
to enable 1-1-8 and 1-
8-8 octal read or octal program operations.

So, this cannot be used for enabling 8D-8D-8D mode... Flashes that only
support 1S-1S-1S and 8D-8D-8D will set this field to 0.

There is a separate table to enable 8D mode called
"Command Sequences to Change to Octal DDR (8D-8D-8D) mode". But if flash
does not have the table or has bad data, fixup hook is the only way...

If mx25* supports above table, please build on top of Pratyush's series
to add support for parsing this table. Otherwise, macronix would have to
use a fixup hook too...

Where is JESD216F? Latest I can find is JESD216D.01

As I pointed out earlier using above DWORDS seems wrong for 8D-8D-8D,
they can be used for 1-1-8 and 1-
8-8

Is the big/little Endian issue a quirk of the flash or controller? If
its controller specific then it needs to handled in controller driver.

If this is a flash quirk, please point to the waveforms in the flash
datasheet...

Sorry , but others clearly see having single variable to store cmd +
extension is beneficial here. So, I take back my suggestion.
