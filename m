Yes, now the flash is fully enabled. It's the firmware matters, not about the kernel drivers nor the flash.

The flash need some post bfpt fixup. As the page size may configured as 512byte, not the 256byte
parsed from bfpt. So a separate entry is needed. Both Alexander and Sergei provide the solution,
and I add it in my patch.
