Looks like flash vendors don't learn from their mistakes, they keep
adding more features without really thinking about backward
compatibility :-(.

There are 2 main reasons:

1/ board manufacturers usually source their flashes from different
vendors so they're not tied to one of them. That means you can't really
make the compatible too specific or you'd have to deal with DT variants
(one variant per-flash).

2/ I feel like once we start accepting specific compats, people will
try to abuse it and decide that they need one for their flash too,
before even trying to see if there's not a different way to detect the
flash.
