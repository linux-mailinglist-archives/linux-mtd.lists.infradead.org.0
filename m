Well, yes. If the driver has custom ->write_page[_raw](), they should
be patched to handle WP de-assertion/assertion.

Right. 100ns on an operation that takes more than 100us is negligible,
but if you start de-asserting/asserting WP on shorter operations, like
READ_STATUS, that might have an impact.
