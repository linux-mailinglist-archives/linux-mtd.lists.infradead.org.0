But in both cases, we still need to do the same things if the last user is
removed: remove the master key secret, try to evict the inodes, and (if all
inodes could be evicted) unlink the key object from the filesystem-level
keyring.  So the ioctls would be nearly the same; it's just the
"remove key user(s)" step that would be different.

So in my view, these are variants of the same action, which is why it's a flag.
Likewise, there aren't separate ioctls for v1 and v2 policy keys, since
adding/removing those are variants on the same actions, and it allows the ioctls
to be extended to v3 in the future if it ever becomes necessary.

Now, I don't have *that* much of an issue with making it an separate ioctl
FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ALL_USERS.  We can make them call the same function
internally, with a bool argument to distinguish the two ioctls.  It just seems
like an unnecessary complication.

"fscrypt lock" actually doesn't exist yet; it's a missing feature.  My patch to
the fscrypt tool adds it.  So we get to decide on the semantics.  We don't want
to require root, though; so for v2 policy keys, the real semantics have to be
that "fscrypt lock" registers the key for the user, and "fscrypt unlock"
unregisters it for the user.

One could argue that because of this they should be named "fscrypt register_key"
and "fscrypt unregister_key".  However, in the vast majority of cases these will
be run as a single user, with a key that is not shared with any other user.

[In fact, I recently changed the fscrypt tool to automatically set mode 0700 on
new encrypted directories, since most people found it surprising that their
unlocked encrypted files weren't private to them by default.  So if someone
wants to share their encrypted directory with another user, they now also need
to explicitly chmod it, unless the root user is involved.]

So presenting the commands as locking/unlocking a directory is a useful
simplication that makes them much easier to use, IMO.  People shouldn't need to
understand multi-user key registration in order to unlock/lock their personal
encrypted directories.

And if "fscrypt lock" does nevertheless hit the case where other users remain, I
think it would be most user-friendly to print a warning like this:

	Directory not fully locked; other users have added the key.
 	Run 'sudo fscrypt lock --all-users DIR' if you want to force-lock the directory.

We *could* make the --all-users option a separate subcommand like
"fscrypt force_lock", but again to me it seems like a variant of the same thing.

I see it a little differently: I'd prefer for the API to be "secure by default",
i.e. it tries hard to really remove the key, and it returns an error if it
couldn't really be removed (but still did as much as possible).  And if the
caller is fine with some case(s) where the key wasn't truly removed, then they
can just explicitly handle those case(s).

You're suggesting the opposite: the ioctl will return 0 if the key was
unregistered for current user only, or if some files are still in use; and if
someone cares whether the key was *really* removed, then they'd need to check
the additional status bits.

That's easier to misuse in the more important ways, in my view.  Now, it's not a
huge deal, as the API provides the same information either way, and regardless
of which one we choose, I'll make sure it's used correctly in fscrypt, Android,
Chrome OS, etc...

Yes, but wouldn't people assume that if the bitfield is provided, that all the
bits are actually filled in?  Remember that to determine the "in-use files" bit
we have to actually go through the inode list and try to evict all the inodes.
That's not really something we should be doing before the last user is removed.
