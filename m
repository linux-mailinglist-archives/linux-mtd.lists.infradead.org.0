This is a trade-off between the performance and the safety.

If you want to be very safe, you can use
the power-on-reset defaults.
The default register values are chosen to insert long enough
wait time to work with any devices.
Of course, it is slow, though.

Generally speaking, the datasheet spec contains the deviation,
so I think aligning with nand_timings.c will guarantee the
device will work over years.

So, in my understanding, ->setup_data_interface() hook
can simply encode struct nand_sdr_timings into the
controller registers.

One question I am still wondering is why this problem was
triggered only after Linux 4.19

As you said, the clock manager on SOCFPGA can change the
clock frequencies that drive the NAND controller.

In your setting,
denali->clk_rate = 31.25 MHz and denali->clk_x_rate = 125 MHz

But, maybe
denali->clk_rate = 50 MHz and denali->clk_x_rate = 200 MHz
on somebody else's. This exactly matches to the frequencies
the denali drivers originally used.
So, the register values are on the edge in this case.
But, nobody reported the problem before v4.19.

I think you are right.
Most of parameters can be derived from the ONFI datasheet,
but the acc_clks register must contain the propagation delays.

This is why I was asking you to test the iffy patches
that increment the acc_clks by 1 or 2.

This is iffy, but I have no idea to parameterize
the SoC/board-dependent delay.

In the posted patch, I used 'data_setup_on_host'
to avoid the magic number.
