The ftrace chunk size is divide to processors_count for each processor,
by this, each processor has itself chunk. So, cpu0 write to chunk0 and
cpu1 write to chunk1.

The parameter @offset of these interface is the relative position of the

How about this?

It's much similar to panic_write for non-block device, but the position and
data size of panic_write for block device must be aligned to SECTOR_SIZE,
that's why the parameters are @sects and @start_sect. Block device driver
should register it by ``blkoops_register_blkdev``.

Should it be like this?
It means the time of a panic log since the first booting.

How about this?

Sometimes the number of occurrences of oops|panic since the first
booting is important
to judge whether the system is stable.

How about this?

It means that it's OOPS for the 2nd time on the last boot.
