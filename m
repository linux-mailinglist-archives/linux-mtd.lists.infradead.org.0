I'd really like to avoid resorting to 'non-mem' reads if we can. Note
that 'mem' reads work just fine for READ_ID already, and I see nothing
on the controller HW interface that would explain why we need a
dedicated path for READ_STATUS either. If we really have to, because
'mem' read appear to only work when there's at least one address cycle
(as mentioned in the code), then we really want to define a new
CMD+DATA_IN(max_non_mem_data) pattern. Testing the opcode as done in
your proposal is not that great, since it doesn't cover other
operations with a CMD and DATA_IN instruction.

Have you tried doing the same with a regular read
(CMD+DATA_IN(NO_DMA))? IOW, what do you get when you do:


# busybox devmem 0xfe020018 32 0x1
# busybox devmem 0xfe020040 32 0x0
# busybox devmem 0xfe020004 32 0x0
# busybox devmem 0xfe020000 32 0x84080000
# busybox devmem 0xfe021000

or

# busybox devmem 0xfe020018 32 0x4
# busybox devmem 0xfe020040 32 0x0
# busybox devmem 0xfe020004 32 0x0
# busybox devmem 0xfe020000 32 0x84080000
# busybox devmem 0xfe021000

(you can even try with more data to see if that makes a difference).
