We have to patch the upper layers anyway, right?

Yes, this is what I'm complaining about. How can the upper layer know
when it should call prepare/unprepare? Let's take the SPI NAND case,
should we prepare before loading a page in the cache and unprepare
after we're done reading the page, or should we unprepare just after
the page has been loaded in the cache? BTW, you've not patched the SPI
NAND layer to call ->prepare/unprepare().

Yes, that's my point. What prevents the FW from preempting Linux while
it's holding the lock and waiting indefinitely on this lock. Is the FW
running on a separate core? Don't you have other IPs with the same kind
of locks leading to issues if locks are not taken/released in the same
order? ...
