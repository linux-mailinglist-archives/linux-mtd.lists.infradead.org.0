Normally, shouldn't userspace have wiped all copies of the master key
after they have called ADD_KEY?  Why should they be left hanging
around?  Waiting until REMOVE_KEY to remove other copies of the master
key seems.... late.

Yes, but they won't be able to trick other users into using that
incorrect key.  With the old interface, it gets written into the
user's session keyring, which won't get used by another user.  And
with the newer interface, only root is allowed to set v1 key.

These paragraphs starts a bit funny, since we first say "should" in
the first sentence, and then it's followed up by "**must not**" in the
second sentence.  Basically, they *could* do this, but it would just
weaken the security of the system significantly.

At the very least, we should explain the basis of the recommendation.

"Must not" seems a bit strong.  If they do, and a v1 per-file key and
nonce leaks out, then the encryption key will be compromised.  So the
strength of the key will be limited by the weaknesses of the v1
scheme.  But it's not like using a that was originally meant for v1,
and then using it for v2, causes any additional weakness.  Right?
