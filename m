TBH, this is no fun (and I'm doing this on my spare time because I like
open source). I guess our opinions differ waaay too much. I don't
really like band-aid fixes; eg. with vague information "it seems that
the F version adveritses support for Fast Read 4-4-4", what about other
flashes with that idcode and this property. This might break at any time
or with anyone trying support for other flashes with that ID.

That's what I've meant with first come first serve, I'm lucky now that
there was no flash with the same jedec id as the W25Q32JW.

To add the MX25U3232F I could check the JEDEC revision (or the BFPT
length) because it differers from the MX25U3235F. But I don't feel well
doing that. Who says Macronix won't update their description for the
MX25U3235F to the new revision.. FYI the Winbond guys apparently use the
first OTP region to store the JEDEC data, which is clever because they
can update it during production.

see above.

so you'd drop support for them? because SFDP is never read if there is 
no
DUAL_READ or QUAD_READ flag.

Given my reasoning above.. well maybe in the future. The Macronix would 
be
a second source candidate. For now we are using the Winbond flash.

I would rather like to have the flash protection topic and OTP support
sorted out, because that is something we are actually using.
