Can't bootloader detect presence on removable board using some means
like GPIO and then fixup DT to enable/disable flash node?

Seems to be fair assumption IMO, otherwise write operation to such
non-jedec flashes is broken with current SPI NOR/m25p80 driver. But, I
have a different concern even if above assumption is true. See below...

Hmm, This depends on how board is wired right? If MISO line is pulled up
to logic 1 when there is no flash connected then read would result in
0xff. But if the pin is floating read would return undefined value
(maybe 0x0) and code would wrongly assume "flash is connected"?

Also, what if there is a different SPI slave connected to that CS on
removable board that responds to SPINOR_OP_RDSR command?

So, I am not fully convinced that this presence check logic is foolproof
