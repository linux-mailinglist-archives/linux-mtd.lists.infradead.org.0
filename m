Well, as you said, this should have been discussed in linux-mtd :-/ And
therefore why my first question on this thread was where is the backend
driver.

This directory is not just for HyperBus controllers but also for flash
drivers.
While HF uses CFI command set, its not necessary that other HyperBus
memory devices do. For example HyperRAM would need a separate driver
which would be under this directory. Even, HF would need a translation
layer from map_* APIs for controllers that can't use map_ APIs directly
and to add HF only features

Then there is need to support HF only controllers such as TI's
HyperBus controller which does not support any of the SPI modes or full
xSPI specification but just initial HyperBus protocol.
I don't think drivers/spi is the right place for such controllers.

That's is not my concern and above statements on ML won't help either..
Lets have a constructive discussion and come up with solution is that
maintainable in long term :-/

My aim was to explore whether its possible to support OSPI and HF using
a single driver without needing two frontend drivers and avoid switching
b/w two drivers when supporting xSPI compliant HFs

Again, I did not insist on extending spi_mem_op to be the _only_
option. I said we should have a generic framework to support controllers
such as RPC-IF which supports both OSPI and HF and one of the options is
to extend spi_mem_op.

And I am not responsible for RPC-IF series to go to v19 :(

HyperBus framework is pretty small and can be refractored quite easily
to support spi_mem_op extension

OK, if there are no DT bindings for each of the frontend drivers then
this should not be concern.

Since, Mark seems okay with current approach (per IRC discussions)
and is not keen on extending spi_mem_ops, I will look at this patch as is.

PS: I cannot reply to you on IRC as I am on the opposite end of timezone.
