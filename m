Unless I missed something there's nothing here which is fscrypt
specific.  Granted that it's somewhat unlikely that someone would want
to implement (the very bloated) IKE from IPSEC in the kernel, I wonder
if there might be other users of HKDF, and whether this would be
better placed in lib/ or crypto/ instead of fs/crypto?

Other than that, looks good.  Feel free to add:
