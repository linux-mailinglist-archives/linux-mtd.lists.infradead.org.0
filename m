okay, more changelog as

1. Patched the Kdoc for both lock_area/unlock_area and _suspend/_resume
2. Created a helper to read default protected value (after device power =

on)
        for protection function detection.
3. patched the prefix for Macronix deep power down command, 0xB9
4. Patched the description of mxic_nand_resume() and add a small sleeping =

delay.
5. Created a helper for deep power down device part number detection.
