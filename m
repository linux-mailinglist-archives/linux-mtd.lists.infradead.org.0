Breaking backward compatibility and keeping the locking state of the spi-nor 
flashes at probe is a no-go, because there might be user space apps that 
expect that all the spi-nor flashes are by default unlocked. The unlocking of 
the flash at probe time was introduced 12 years ago, we definitely can't 
change this now.

I would go with 2/ or 3/. Vignesh, what do you prefer and why?
