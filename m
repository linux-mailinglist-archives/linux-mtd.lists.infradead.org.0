Even if we don't do it right now, I don't see the harm in making a 
future dev's life just a little bit easier by not forcing them to find 
this problem and fix this just the way I suggested. If you do it that 
way, you still end up using an address width of 3 so it makes no 
difference to you.

But this hypothetical situation aside, there is the problem of when 
someone wants to use a flash with the address width configured to 4 on 
boot. Once the BFPT is parsed, the post-BFPT hook runs. Here, if you are 
using a non-default address width, you'd check the flash configuration 
to see if 4-byte addressing is used, and update nor->addr_width 
accordingly. If you hard-code 3 there, then SMPT parsing would fail in 
such a situation. At $DAYJOB, we have a use-case like this where we use 
a flash configured in 4-byte addressing.

I think you've misunderstood what the address width and dummy cycles are 
for. They are used for the configuration detection command, which is 
used to find out which configuration the flash is in, and then use the 
appropriate sector map for that configuration.

This configuration is unlikely to be in the SFDP table. AFAIK, SFDP 
table is static and won't change based on flash config. Instead, this 
configuration will likely be in a flash register. For example, on the 
Cypress S28 flash family, it lies in the register CFR3.

The latency cycles needed for accessing these registers are completely 
unrelated to the latency cycles needed for SFDP. As an example, on the 
S28 family, you need 8 latency cycles for reading SFDP, but need 3-6 
(configurable) cycles for reading a volatile register, like CFR3. So, 
using the SFDP address width and the SFDP latency cycles for these 
commands would be completely incorrect, and would only work by chance.

You should instead populate the dummy cycles for your flash in 
nor->read_dummy, and the address width in nor->addr_width. If these 
can't be properly detected by BFPT, please use the post-BFPT hook 
instead, which runs before SMPT (or any optional table for that matter) 
parsing.
