Hello Ken,

I create a UBI image with 3 separate volumes - 2 of these are a specified fixed size and the third is specified as the minimum needed to hold the current files with the auto resize flag set. As a note, before the first run auto resize operation, there is over 200 MiB of unused space in the NAND - meaning there should be plenty of free space available for UBI to leave overhead when auto-resizing for bad block handling. Another point of note, is that I use UBI within U-Boot as well in order to read the kernel image and dtb out of the UBIFS.

What this means is that it will complete the one time re-size operation. I used a Linux ramdisk image to flash from Linux and mount UBI in Linux for the first time to allow it to complete the auto-resize operation instead and compared:

Obviously there are ways around this issue (program and mount UBI from Linux initially, don't use autoresize and specify all volume sizes, etc) but was wondering if there is some underlying problem. I noticed an older mailing discussion from several years ago where someone reported a similar issue regarding number of bad PEBs and seems the issue was chalked up to a potential driver problem on one side:

We use in U-Boot the code from linux 4.2 (commit 64291f7db5bd8150a74ad2036f1037e6a0428df2)
(Yes, very old in the meantime)

So may there is a problem with this old code base in U-Boot?

Volunteers for rebasing the U-Boot ubi/ubifs code with a newer
linux version are welcome.

But reading your Email again, may you should first investigate, why U-Boot
and Linux see different good PEBs.

Also your kernel drops the warning:

ubi0 warning: ubi_eba_init: cannot reserve enough PEBs for bad PEB handling, reserved 71, need 73

You should look here deeper into it.

bye,
Heiko
