As I mentioned in the commit, *currently* we use 1S-1S-1S mode to read SFDP, which is also
the last operation we did here. So I use the same address byte and dummy cycles here.
I think we won't meet the exception you mentioned, as it will fail when parsing SFDP
and won't come here.

I agree that currently we don't meet all the conditions. But your patch seems alike the way
here. AS you set address width when parsing BFPT, but it'll not be changed before parsing SMPT
here, we parse smpt once bfpt is parsed and don't do specific vendor operations, etc.

As I've mentioned above, it follows the behaviour in the current framework. What do you think of
introduce new field in spi_nor to provide more flexibility:

    struct spi_nor {
        ...
        sfdp_addr_width;
        sfdp_read_dummy;
        ...
    }

we can initialized it in the quite beginning(perhap in spi_nor_scan()) and let others to modify it.
It will also provide sfdp access and flash access with different parameter if necessary.
