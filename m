                                      set it to 0 or ignore it.

The example above is:  blkoops.dmesg_size=64
where 64 is not a multiple of 4096. (?)

That is confusing (to me). It seems like it handles CPU packages separately,
so that a package that has 4 processors is collected together.
But what if the system has multiple CPU packages?  how is that handled?
