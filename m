Or (just throwing another idea out there) the dentry's name could be copied to a
temporary buffer in ->d_compare().  The simplest version would be:

	u8 _name[NAME_MAX];

	memcpy(_name, name, len);
	name = _name;

Though, 255 bytes is a bit large for a stack buffer (so for long names it may
need kmalloc with GFP_ATOMIC), and technically it would need a special version
of memcpy() to be guaranteed safe from compiler optimizations (though I expect
this would work in practice).

Alternatively, take_dentry_name_snapshot() kind of does this already, except
that it takes a dentry and not a (name, len) pair.
