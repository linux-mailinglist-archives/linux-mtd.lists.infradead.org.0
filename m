From what you say below, it was defined in a machine configuration file,
so modify it there. It;s fine *for debugging purposes* to modify the
original file but in the case of machine configuration file, once you've
settled with some modifications, you need to create a new one in your
own layer and add the changes there so they can be shared with people
(conf/local.conf is NOT supposed to be shared).

But UBOOT_CONFIG = "nand" looks decent to me (it's a machine specific
variable, so rather set it in the machine configuration file).

I'd first have a look what this ",sdcard" thing is doing (c.f.
http://cgit.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/tree/meta/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot.inc?h=thud).

You're mixing things up. If you want the ubi command to be present in
U-Boot, you need to put it in the U-Boot defconfig. Kernel defconfig has
nothing to do with it. Though, you might want ubi support in the kernel
but that's unrelated to your current issue.

I've seen a few mails from you recently on the mailing list which are
more or less sequels to previous mails. FWIW, we have an IRC channel on
freenode at #yocto, that might be helpful if you have quick questions
(e.g. your "applying a patch" mail).

I find Yocto to not be the most forgiving when copy-pasting stuff from
the internet. I'd suggest to invest a little bit of time in reading the
source code of what you're trying to modify (u-boot recipes, classes,
etc.), you also have an extensive documentation here:
https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6.4/mega-manual/mega-manual.html
it is a manual containing all the other manuals you can find per topic
here: https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/

I can also suggest Live coding sessions with Jozef on the project's YT
channel https://www.youtube.com/user/TheYoctoProject. (It's Twitch
streams uploaded to YT so if you'd rather watch when he's streaming:
https://www.twitch.tv/letoatreidesthe2nd

I want to end those recommendations on a note: sending mails is perfectly
fine :)

Have fun with Yocto,
Quentin
