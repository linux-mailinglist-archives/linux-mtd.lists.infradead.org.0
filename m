In all those, the bisection either blamed the wrong commit or failed entirely.
So rather than supporting your argument, they're actually examples of how a
reproduction frequency of 1 causes the result to be unreliable.

What I have in mind is that syzbot would assign a confidence level to each
bisection log.

Start at 100% confident.

If multiple different crash signatures were seen, decrease the confidence level.

If the crash is probabilistic (sometimes occurred n/10 times where 1 <= n <= 9),
decrease the confidence level again.  If it ever occurred just 1 time, decrease
it a lot more.  OFC it could be a smarter, more complex calculation using some
formula, but this would be the minimum.

If bisection ended on merge commit, release commit, or is obviously a non-code
change (e.g. only modified Documentation/), decrease the confidence level again.

Then:

- If bisection result is very confident, mail out the result as-is.
- If bisection result is somewhat confident, mail out the result with a warning
  that syzbot detected that it may be unreliable.
- Otherwise don't mail out the result, just keep it on the syzbot dashboard.

Yes, these are heuristics.  Yes, they will sometimes be wrong and cause false
negatives.  I don't need you to go into multi page explanation of all the
theoretical edge cases.  But they should reduce false positive rate massively,
which will encourage people to actually look at the reports...

It seems you don't want to be "responsible" for a false negative, so you just
send out every result.  But that just makes the reports low quality so people
ignore them, which is much worse.  The status quo of sending reports to authors
of kernel commits selected at random is really not acceptable.

So don't be surprised when people ignore syzbot reports for the same reason.
