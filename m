Is your question why not use device-tree on the user configuration
side? Here are my answer about it.

There is an important difference between blkoops and ramoops.
The ramoops can be initialized at any time since ram already be
ready. However, blkoops must waits for block_dev registering.

If blkoops use device-tree like ramoops do, it sometimes fails to
open block device because of block device not ready even though
it is initialized later by using late_initcall(). Take MMC as am example.
Block devices of MMC will not register until a few seconds after
MMC driver initialization. During waiting MMC block device, blkoops
has already been called and fails to initialize. Instead of using
device-tree and waiting for block device for several seconds, I
prefer to not initialize until block driver call it.

How about just getting the user configurations from device-tree but not
do initialize until block driver calls it? It seems illogical.

No, non-block here means devices such as MTD device which is not a block
device and do not use generic block layer.

Notes of non-block here seems too early. I will make a separate patch to
support non-block.

The device driver here means block device driver and non-block device
driver.
It is loose to just name it as "block device driver".

Well, I think it's time to explain my design ideas.

Before blkoops, I read through the code of ramoops.
How similar blkoops is to ramoops and their management of storage
space is completely repetitive. The only difference between of them,
I think, is just different storage media.

So, why not extract a common layer from ramoops and blkoops to allocate
and manager storage sapce? That is what psotre/blk (blkzone.c) do. The
ramoops and the blkoops do not care about the use of storage.

I don't know whether the common layer is good enough to ramoops and
whether is good time to rename the common layer from pstore/blk to
psotre/zone?

How about Makefile and Kconfig as follow?

	<Kconfig>
	config PSOTRE_ZONE
		# NOTE.
		# the configuration is hidden from users and selected by
		# pstore/blk.
		help
		  The common layer for pstore/blk (and pstore/ram in the future)
		  to manager storage as zones.
	config PSTORE_BLK
		tristate "Log panic/oops to a block device"
		select PSOTRE_ZONE
		help
		  ......
	config PSTORE_BLK_DMESG_SIZE
		......

	<Makefile>
	#  Note: rename blkzone.c to pstore_zone.c
	obj-$(CONFIG_PSTORE_ZONE) += pstore_zone.c

	# Note: rename blkoops.c to pstore_blk.c
	obj-$(CONFIG_PSTORE_BLK) += pstore_blk.c

To be honest, I named it dmesg_size on purpose since I think
record_size is ambiguous. It describes the size of dmesg recorder
rather than size of all recorder.

dump_oops defaults to -1 means using configuration on Kconfig,
while the default value on Kconfig is 1, which means default to
catch oopses.

Module parameters have priority over Kconfig. If we defualt module
parameter dump_oops to 1 at here, configuration on Kconfig will run
out  of work.

It's fine to dmesg_size and dump_oops but not pmsg_size, ftrace_size
and console_size, because they will be not available sometimes.

I disagree to use "default 64 if PSTORE_PMSG" instead of
"depends on PSTORE_PMSG", and explain in patch 3.

bo_dev is a structure defined in blkoops and not available to bzinfo.

At the very beginning of my design, the pstore/blk is a common layer
for  blkoops and ramoops. So, it's not suitable for bzinfo to keep a
pointer to structure of blkoops.

You are right. I will change to use ITER_KVEC to remove set_fs().

I will keep generic_file_read_iter() rather than vfs_iter_read().
Blkoops fails to read/write with vfs_iter_read/write() since it
does not have a valid 'struct file' to block device. It's so ugly
to vfs_open() block_device to get 'struct file'. Why not just use
interfaces on generic block layer because we have got
struct block_dev already.

Besides, SELinux reports error if we open, read, and write to
a block directly.

I'd  use pr_debug rather than pr_err. Because we allow mulitiple
devices to attempt to register to blkoops. It's not an error.

pr_debug("invalid major %u (expect %u)\n", major, MAJOR(bdev->bd_dev));

This function is reserved for block driver to get information about the
using
block device. So it can't be removed.

Sure, a new structrue is created to cached these values.
