I'm not aware of any other command that would return well-known data.

Yes there is, but it comes with a lot of strings attached. There is a 
hardware reset pin on some flashes that puts the flash in Power-on-Reset 
(POR) mode. But that pin is not mandatory. It also might not be 
connected on a given board.

The other option is a "Soft Reset" (also optional), which puts the flash 
in POR mode after it is given the soft reset command. But to send the 
command you need to know the mode the device is in. On top of that, the 
Soft Reset opcode differs between flashes. According to the xSPI spec, 
some flashes can have the opcode as 0xF0 and some others can have it as 
a two command sequence of 0x66 and 0x99.

And the cherry on top is the fact that these reset operations return to 
a state based on the value of the non-volatile bits. So, if the 
non-volatile configuration is 8D-8D-8D mode, then all these resets 
achieve nothing.

Unfortunately, I don't really see a better alternative. Just so I 
understand this better, why do you think it is something worth avoiding?

A simple bootloader might not even have a SPI driver. So, if the flash 
PORs to 8D-8D-8D, Linux would be unable to use the flash.

Or, if the ROM puts the flash in 8D-8D-8D mode for better boot speed, we 
would have the same problem.
