   It was still marked RFC back in December and I haven't received any
feedback since, other than Dirk's request. Where have you been? Well,
I should have CCed linux-mtd back then... :-/

   Why did you create this directory for, anyway? :-/

   Really? This may be not much of an issue with coding this but it's
certainly time consuming (I'm sure there's s/th to think about yet in
this case)? My management (and also me, so far) believes I'm in the
final stage with these drivers... what should I say to my boss now?

   Seriously, only "moving"?

   Which (surprise!) only adds support for the SPI part...

   What DT issues do you mean exactly? I think that other than changing
the "home" dir for the bindings, there'd little to change. The "front ends"
don't deal with the DT probing...
