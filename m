sure.

It's already implemented in spi-nor framework. As for sequential operations,
taking read as an example, the call stack looks like:

->spi_nor_read()
---->spi_nor_lock_and_prep()
------->spi_nor_controller_ops->prepare() or spi_mem_prepare() in PATCH 1/3
...
---->spi_nor_read_data() // maybe called several times
...
---->spi_nor_unlock_and_unprep()
------->spi_nor_controller_ops->unprepare() or spi_mem_unprepare() in PATCH 1/3

As for nand flash, I didn't add it in this RFC as I'm not certain where
should prepare/unprepare be called.

If we use spi_mem_exec_sequence() seems we'll do more works to adapt, at least
at spi-nor side. what do you think?

The firmware is running on a separate co-processor so it may not preempt
the linux.
