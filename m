Almost a factor 3. I was definitely not expecting interrupt-based waits
to have such a huge impact on the perfs.

Well, that's only true at mount time (and if you delay the mount after
the boot, your CPU might already have other things to do), but any
erase/write operations are likely to monopolize your CPU for no good
reason.

Let's not add more module params than we already have, it just
confuses users and deciding how to wait on HW events doesn't sounds
like something they should be able to choose anyway (just like passing
the timing params, this should be calculated by the driver). Oh well,
I'll drop the patch adding interrupt-based waits. Having the driver
converted to exec_op() is more than enough :-).
