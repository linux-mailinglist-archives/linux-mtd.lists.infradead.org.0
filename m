I do agree with what you say, but... (see below).

Too lazy to get the list from Micron?! I can tell you we've tried hard
and they've always been reluctant to give us such a list, or a
discriminant to identify those buggy parts. They even tried to
convince us it was not a bug but a problem that's inherent to any NAND
flashes, not only theirs. They didn't go as far as claiming this was a
feature, but given the energy they spent to deny the problem I
honestly thought they would. So no, it's definitely not what you think,
and I was hoping that threatening them to merge that patch upstream
would force them to provide us this information. Looks like it never
happened.

Maybe those that had to debug those weird/hardly reproducible issues
should speak up, because that's no fun thing to spend weeks/months
chasing such bugs just to discover that Micron knows about the issue and
can provide a fix if you ask them.

I honestly don't have a good solution here. I guess we could blacklist
flashes one by one when people report weird issues, but when they
discover the problem is already too late, and they have plenty of units
in the wild.

Boris
