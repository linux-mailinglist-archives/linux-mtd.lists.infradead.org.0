Ah, good idea, I should've thought of this.

They don't make the old stuff real easy to find, but it looks as though
Debian jumped from mtd-tools 20011217-3 in 3.0 (Woody) to 20050122-2 in
3.1 (Sarge) -- quite a big jump.  I also tried Fedora and couple distros
that targeted embedded systems without much luck.  But I can keep
looking.

I just noticed that one of the versions in our source repo is referred
to as 20040219.  That's plausible, considering 2.4.26 was released a
couple months after that.  Still, it would be nice to be able to verify
that the code there matches the original release.

Okay, this is the situation I inherited: JFFS2 images that were
generated with mkfs.jffs2 from ~2012 are being used in production with
target systems running 2.4.26.  To me it was a potential "red flag" from
the start (without knowing any internal details), and discovering that
image files generated by differing versions didn't match didn't make me
feel any better about it.  But I'm glad to hear there are no obvious
incompatibilities.  I'll have to check the command line, but I doubt
we're using any newer features.

Very true! :-)

The device I've been hired to work on is used in the building automation
and HVAC industries, where support cycles can run decades, rather than
years (or months) as in many other fields.  Some of the issues I've
fixed have been within the client's own software, but some have been in
the platform -- in custom hardware drivers, for example.  Each one comes
with some sort of calculation of cost (typically my time) and risk,
compared to expected benefit in the field.

In this case, I discovered that a relatively high proportion of
defective units returned from customer sites (that were attributable to
failures in this part of the system) have moderate to severe file system
corruption.  There are many possible explanations, but one of my
theories about it is unfortunate timing of power cuts, relative to file
writes or garbage collection, say.  If this was a known vulnerability of
the otherwise "stable" 2.4 JFFS code, dealing with that would be a high
priority; if not, I'd look elsewhere first.

Moving to a modern kernel, while _very_ appealing in so many ways, is
probably not something that the client would buy into for this
long-obsolete (development-wise) product -- at least not without that
cost-benefit calculation showing that it's an overall win.  I'm not even
sure the core hardware is still supported with modern Linuxes and
toolchains.

So the "pharma" involved here is kind of related to my salary. :-)

Don Estabrook
