No, I was talking about 1b.  I'd argue that 1a and 1b should be
different ioctl.  1b requires root, and 1a doesn't.

And 1a should just mean, "I don't need to use the encrypted files any
more".  In the PAM passphrase case, when you are just logging out, 1a
is what's needed, and success is just fine.  pam_session won't *care*
whether or not there are other users keeping the key in use.

The problem with "fscrypt lock" is that the non-privileged user sort
of wants to do REMOVE_FLAG_KEY_FLAG_FOR_ALL_USERS, but they doesn't
have the privileges to do it, and they are hoping that removing their
own key removes it the key from the system.  That to me seems to be
the fundamental disconnect.  The "fscrypt unlock" and "fscrypt lock"
commands comes from the v1 key management, and requires root.  It's
the translation to unprivileged mode where "fscrypt lock" seems to
have problems.

So my perspective is that the ioctl's should have very clean
semantics, and errors should be consistent with how the Unix system
calls and error reporting.

If we need to make "fscrypt lock" and "fscrypt unlock" have semantics
that are more consistent with previous user interface choices, then
fscrypt can use FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS to print the warning
before it calls FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY --- with "fscrypt purge_keys"
calling something like FS_IOC_REMOVE_ALL_USER_ENCRYPTION_KEYS.

I meant adding an output field.  I see EBUSY and EUSERS as status bits
which *some* use cases might find useful.  Other use cases, such as in
the pam_keys session logout code, we won't care at *all* about those
status reporting (or error codes).  So if EBUSY and EUSERS are
returned as errors, then it adds to complexity of those programs
whichd don't care.  (And even for those that do, it's still a bit more
complex since they has to distinguish between EBUSY, EUSERS, or other
errors --- in fact, *all* programs which use
FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY will *have* to check for EBUSY and
ESUSERS whether they care or not.)

That's actually an implementation detail, though, right?  In theory,
we could check to see if there are any in-use files, independently of
whether there are any users or not.
