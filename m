No, because then the device tree is wrong and doesn't fit the hardware. 
You'd
have to some instance which could change the device tree node, like the
bootloader or some device tree overlay for plugable flashes. We should 
try to
solve the actual problem at hand first..

It is just not possible to autodetect the SPI flash, just because
the vendors reuse the same IDs for flashes with different features (and 
the
SFDP is likely not enough). Therefore, you need to have a hint in some 
place
to use the flash properly.

It is not only the name, here are two examples which differ in 
functionality:
  (1) mx25l8005 doesn't support dual/quad mode. mx25l8006e supports 
dual/quad
      mode
  (2) mx25u3235f doesn't support TB bit, mx25u3232e has a TB bit.

well.. to repeat myself, the mx25l25635_post_bfpt_fixups is a third 
example.
