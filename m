Absolutely right. In this case these are the physically mapped ROMs in
the mtd subsystem notation. So they are the subjects of
drivers/mtd/maps/physmap-* driver. Though these ROMs require a
word-aligned access, so I had to implement a dedicated
driver/mtd/maps/physmap-bt1-rom.c code. I'll submit it after we
finish with this patchset, settle the issues raised in its framework.

Absolutely right. It's a set of DW APB SSI registers, so normally it
would be a subject of drivers/spi/{spi-dw-mmio.c,spi-dw.c} driver, but
due to very limited resources (no DMA, no IRQ, just 8 bytes FIFO, a
single native chip-select) and a racy access from 2/, that code won't
work, but would only after a serious refactoring, so I had to create
a dedicated driver for it.

Yes, it's another physically mapped ROM, which is a mirror of either 1/
or 2/ depending on the SoC boot mode strapped at the chip startup.

So to speak 1/ is always mapped (it's Internal ROM), 2/ is a physically
mapped SPI ROM, 3/ is an SPI controller itself primarily dedicated to
access the SPI ROM, and 4/ is a mirror of 1/ or 2/. The problem is in
simultaneous access to 2/ and 3/ and to 4/ when the SPI-boot mode is enable=
d.
Here is the Boot Controller structure together with comments of how my
current drivers design is using it:

Boot Controller (0x1f040000 0x100) - root MFD device.
|
+---+-> 1/ Internal ROM (0x1bfc0000 0x10000) - seen as /dev/mtdX (64KB of i=
nternal firmware).
|  \
+---+-> 4/ Boot ROM (0x1fc00000 0x400000) - seen as /dev/mtdY (4MB mirror o=
f either Internal ROM or SPI ROM depending on the SoC boot mode strapped at=
 the chip startup).
|  /
+---+-> 3/ SPI ROM (0x1c000000 0x1000000) - seen as /dev/mtdZ.
|   |
|  \  - This is a switch, which is handled by a flag in the Boot Controller=
 register 0x1f040000.
+-- +-> 2/ DW APB SSI registers (0x1f040100 0xf00) - seen as SPI-dev +-----=
-> Connected to CS0 external SPI-nor flash - seen as mtdN
                                                                     |
                                                                     +-----=
-> Might be connected to any other SPI-slave with using GPIO-based chip-sel=
ect.

So as you can see, a system software can access either SPI/Boot ROM or DW A=
PB SSI
registers at a time, not simultaneously. That's why I needed a dedicated
API, which would serialize an access to the DW APB SSI registers. This
is what the MFD driver submitted by this patchset is intended for. It
provides a lock, which makes sure that either SPI/Boot ROM or DW APB SSI
is enabled while lock is held. In addition the MFD driver is responsible
for the sub-devices population.

See the https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/27/273 message for some more
details.

Agreed. I've got a driver for it, but it will be
drivers/mtd/maps/physmap-bt1-rom.c (will use the common code
drivers/mtd/maps/physmap-core.c), since it's just a ROM. Alas the ROM
will have no direct mapping due to the word-aligned access restriction
(no-unaligned-direct-access property). Due to this restriction I also had
to create a dedicated code in drivers/mtd/maps/physmap-bt1-rom.c instead
of using generic "mtd-rom" compatible binding.

My new SPI-controller driver does implement the spi-mem infrastructure,
but it also implements a generic SPI callbacks so to allow any SPI-slave
(not only the Boot SPI-flash) being connected to the SPI bus. The
generic SPI callbacks are also required if GPIO-based chip-select is
available for the SPI-flash (don't really know why you permitted this
restriction in spi_mem_exec_op() instead of enabling the slave device at
the time of mem_op-based communications). Since 2/ and 4/ are handled by
drivers/mtd/maps/physmap-bt1-rom.c, there is no direct-mapping
implemented for this SPI-controller.

> For 4/ I don't know what is the right thing to do yet.
> =


That's one of the reason why I implemented it in a way it's implemented.
1/, 2/ and 4/ are the physically mapped ROMs handled by the
drivers/mtd/maps/physmap-bt1-rom.c driver, while 3/ is just an SPI-controll=
er.
And all of them are parts of a single MFD - Baikal-T1 Boot Controller.
Moreover current Boot Controller DT-nodes structure is as much as possible
close to the structure of the device and its subnodes from hardware
point of view. Such design looked neat and elegant for me. It also
covered all parts of the RTL block.

> What do you think?
>  =


Yes, your design was my first thought. I also had in mind to implement
2/ as a direct mapping of 3/ . But then I didn't find spi-nor using the
direct mapping interface, I also didn't come up with a solution for 4/
and seeing 1/, 2/ and 4/ having the same properties I decided that it
would be better to make them being exported as a dedicated mtd'es.

So, Miqu=E8l, do you still think that my decision was wrong and it would be
better to create your version of the design? If so, folks, what to do with =
4/
then, just drop?
