I am using barebox for booting. I looked at the code and found a comment in 
denali_hw_init: 
         * tell driver how many bit controller will skip before
         * writing ECC code in OOB, this register may be already
         * set by firmware. So we read this value out.
         * if this value is 0, just let it be.

I have checked the barebox code and the denali register SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES 
(offset 0x230) is read only once on booting. I have not found any occurrence of 
the register being set by barebox. So i would concur as the value is zero in 
my case that the boot ROM seems not to set the value. The code in barebox is 
mostly imported from linux in 2015 which is before the reorganization which 
happened on the linux side later on.

I have hardware available to me, so i would be happy to test any ideas/
guesses.
