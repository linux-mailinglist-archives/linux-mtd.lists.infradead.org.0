Hi Andy,

Yes, that would seem the proper thing to do. So the SPI NOR driver is 
based on micron m25p80 and compatible string is "jedec,spi-nor", so I 
don't know who should or would do this registration.

Well there is none AFAIK.

Yeah, so we could do this. But, as I mentioned already, this could mean 
that we conflicting properties. For this the kernel driver prob should 
only pay attention to properties which ACPI cannot describe.

Even better would be to update the ACPI spec, especially for something 
general like SPI bus width

BTW, Do any of these sensors you mention have any ACPI standardization?

Thanks,
John
