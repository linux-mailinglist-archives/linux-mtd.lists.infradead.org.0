Thanks! for the keep reviewing.

SW Address translation is not required, after discussion with HW team , 
came to know that 0x17400 and 0x17C00 internal to the SoC.

NOC will translate 0xE1XX... to FPI address 0x17X... internally.
There is an address translation in the NOC.
0x17X... is not visible to user.

so far added hard-coded values to CS0 and CS1 is not at required.
I will change the code accordingly and sent to you.

Vadivel
