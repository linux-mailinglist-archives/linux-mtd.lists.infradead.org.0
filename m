I realize how fragile this ID-based detection is when manufacturers
decide to not follow the standard READID semantic (one 0x9f command byte
followed by 1 or more input cycles encoding the ID). Let's imagine you
have a valid manuf ID byte in ID[0], and the device ID (ID[1]) matches
the Winbond or Gigadevice manufacturer ID, and ID[3] (extended Device ID
byte?) matches a valid Winbond/Gigadevice device ID. If you skip the
check on ID[0] you might erroneously detect a Winbond or Gigadevice
NAND, while it's actually something else.

Note that I don't really have a solution to make this detection more
robust.

I think we should fix that problem now. Maybe by doing a 3 steps
detection:

1/ READID + ID[]
2/ READID + DUMMY + ID[]
3/ READID + ADDR + ID[]

At each step we would check if the returned ID matches a valid NAND,
and if it does, stop there.
