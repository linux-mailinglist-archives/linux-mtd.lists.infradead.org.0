It is a typo...

Please refer to reply email of patch 2 for reason why I separate blkzone
from
blkoops.

Sure. I will try to do so.

That's not about blkzone.c. Or you want to get rid of configurations for
driver?

I just want to use non-block to express _not_ block devices, such as mtd
device.
Maybe I get non-block wrong?
